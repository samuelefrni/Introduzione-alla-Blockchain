# Introduzione alla Blockchain
Hello, I'm Samuele Furnari, and this is my first project in Solidity for Start2Impact.

# Project
One of the founders of the organization would like to take advantage of the blockchain, as this innovative technology could be just what they are looking for to automate the collections they organize monthly.

However, he does not have the necessary knowledge to exploit the technology, so he asks you for a hand in carrying out the project and in explaining to him what is behind a job of this type.

To satisfy his requests, he develops a single smart contract with the knowledge gained in the theory, assuming that it is a prototype and therefore manages only one test collection.

# Request
* A variable representing the total balance collected
* An "address" type variable representing the address of the fundraising manager, instantiated when the contract is created
* A variable representing the goal set by the collection creator, instantiated when the contract is created
* A variable that contains the total number of donors
* A variable that determines whether the fundraiser is completed or not, depending on the achievement of the goal
* A function that allows you to donate Ether to the contract, updating the balance and the number of donors
* A function that allows only the fundraising manager to withdraw the Ether collected in the contract
* A function that closes the fundraising
* A function that checks whether the goal set by the creator of the collection has been met, or exceeded.
